# Example: one HBN participant

This example runs MPAT on real data: one participant of the Healthy Brain Network
Processed Open Diffusion Derivatives (HBN-POD2) {cite}`alexander2017open,richiehalford2022analysis`.
It follows pyAFQ's tutorial
[Getting started with pyAFQ – ParticipantAFQ](https://tractometry.org/pyAFQ/examples/tutorial_examples/plot_002_participant_afq_api.html)
up to the `ParticipantAFQ` object. From there, MPAT replaces tractography and bundle
recognition.

The whole example is one script,
[`examples/hbn_participant.py`](https://github.com/36000/MPAT/blob/main/examples/hbn_participant.py):

```bash
pip install "pyAFQ[aws]"          # boto3, to download HBN-POD2 from its public S3 bucket
python examples/hbn_participant.py --n-proc 8 --max-mem 32GB
```

## The data

`fetch_hbn_preproc` downloads one subject's qsiprep-preprocessed data, about 400 MB, and
organises it as BIDS derivatives under `~/AFQ_data/HBN/`:

```python
import os
import os.path as op

import AFQ.data.fetch as afd
import AFQ.definitions.image as afm
from AFQ.api.participant import ParticipantAFQ

afd.fetch_hbn_preproc(["NDARAA948VFH"])

sub_dir = op.join(afd.afq_home, "HBN", "derivatives", "qsiprep", "sub-NDARAA948VFH")
dwi = op.join(sub_dir, "ses-HBNsiteRU", "dwi",
              "sub-NDARAA948VFH_ses-HBNsiteRU_acq-64dir_space-T1w_desc-preproc_dwi")
anat = op.join(sub_dir, "anat", "sub-NDARAA948VFH")

output_dir = op.join(afd.afq_home, "HBN", "derivatives", "afq", "sub-NDARAA948VFH",
                     "ses-HBNsiteRU", "dwi")
os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)
```

## The pyAFQ participant

As in the tutorial, the partial volume estimates (PVE) and the brain mask come from qsiprep.
MPAT uses the PVE to decide where walkers move (white matter), where they end (grey matter),
and where they never go (CSF). See {ref}`the tissue table <tissue-table>`.

```python
pve = afm.PVEImages(afm.ImageFile(path=f"{anat}_label-CSF_probseg.nii.gz"),
                    afm.ImageFile(path=f"{anat}_label-GM_probseg.nii.gz"),
                    afm.ImageFile(path=f"{anat}_label-WM_probseg.nii.gz"))
brain_mask_definition = afm.ImageFile(path=f"{anat}_desc-brain_mask.nii.gz")

myafq = ParticipantAFQ(
    dwi_data_file=f"{dwi}.nii.gz",
    bval_file=f"{dwi}.bval",
    bvec_file=f"{dwi}.bvec",
    t1_file=f"{anat}_desc-preproc_T1w.nii.gz",
    output_dir=output_dir,
    tracking_params=dict(odf_model="CSD"),
    pve=pve,
    brain_mask_definition=brain_mask_definition,
)
```

One difference from the tutorial: `tracking_params` only names the fODF model. pyAFQ's
seeding options (`n_seeds`, `random_seeds`, `rng_seed`) do not apply, because MPAT does not
sample streamlines. It launches one streamline's worth of walker mass from **every** voxel of
the white/grey-matter interface, and follows all of it exactly.

## Running MPAT

```python
import mpat

results = mpat.run(myafq, n_proc=8, max_mem="32GB")      # -> <output_dir>/mpat/
```

`mpat.run` asks pyAFQ for what it needs:
- the CSD fODF
- the tissue PVE and the brain mask
- the white/grey-matter interface, for the seeds
- the registration to the template, to warp each bundle's ROIs to the subject

It does not need pyAFQ's tractography. It then builds the chain once and solves for every
bundle in pyAFQ's default bundle dictionary.

On this participant, with 8 threads:

| | |
|---|---|
| white-matter voxels | 66,809 |
| chain | 1,737,034 states (voxels × 26 direction classes), 94.9 million transitions, 1.0 GB, built in 19 s |
| seeds | 23,801 interface voxels → 62,569 half-walk pairs (one streamline per seed, split over its fODF peaks) |
| solves | 36 bundles in two groups of columns (`max_mem="32GB"` fits up to 191 columns per group); each group is one backward and one forward series, 126–149 steps to the $10^{-10}$ tolerance |
| time | 17.6 minutes for MPAT. The first run also downloads the data and computes pyAFQ's derivatives (DTI and CSD fits, registration): about 30 minutes in all |

Every bundle's `endpoint_mass_check` is 1 to within $10^{-5}$ (the largest deviation, $7.5 \times 10^{-6}$, is for the bundle with the fewest expected streamlines, Callosum Temporal).

## Results

```{figure} ../static/examples/hbn_bundles.png
:name: fig-hbn-bundles
:alt: Six MPAT bundle densities, as sagittal and axial maximum-intensity projections over FA

Six of the 36 bundles, as maximum-intensity projections of the density over FA, with each
bundle's core in blue. Images are shown in RAS orientation: the subject's left is on the left
of the axial views, anterior is up in the axial views, and anterior is to the right in the
sagittal views. Each bundle's density is drawn on its own log scale, from $10^{-3}$ of its peak
to its peak, so the panels show each bundle's shape but not its absolute size; that is set by
the expected streamline counts below.
```

```{figure} ../static/examples/hbn_left_arcuate.png
:name: fig-hbn-arcuate
:alt: The left arcuate's density on sagittal, coronal and axial slices through its core

The left arcuate on three slices through the midpoint of its core: expected visits per
voxel, over FA.
```

Each bundle's files are described in {doc}`outputs`. The run's table,
`sub-NDARAA948VFH_ses-HBNsiteRU_acq-64dir_desc-mpat_table.tsv`, lists every bundle:

Expected streamlines are counted out of the 23,801 seeds, one streamline per seed. Each count
is the sum over seeds of the probability that the seed's streamline meets the bundle's
definition. *Columns* is the number of solution columns the bundle needed: one per pair of
avoid set (from its include ROIs) and end kind (from its endpoint ROIs).

| bundle | expected streamlines | columns |
|---|---:|---:|
| Left Optic Radiation | 0.55 | 8 |
| Right Optic Radiation | 1.6 | 8 |
| Left Anterior Thalamic | 0.88 | 8 |
| Right Anterior Thalamic | 0.22 | 8 |

| Left Superior Longitudinal III | 22.6 | 8 |
| Right Superior Longitudinal I | 5.2 | 8 |
| Right Superior Longitudinal II | 15.2 | 8 |
| Right Superior Longitudinal III | 32.0 | 8 |
| Callosum Anterior Frontal | 11.8 | 8 |
| Callosum Motor | 0.69 | 8 |
| Callosum Occipital | 0.17 | 8 |
| Callosum Orbital | 0.97 | 8 |
| Callosum Posterior Parietal | 0.02 | 8 |
| Callosum Superior Frontal | 2.0 | 8 |
| Callosum Superior Parietal | 0.08 | 8 |
| Callosum Temporal | 0.0017 | 8 |

The counts range over five orders of magnitude, from 266 for the right vertical occipital
fasciculus to 0.002 for the callosal temporal bundle.

## Looking at the bundles interactively

In a notebook, `mpat.view` shows the densities, cores and visitation-ODF glyphs in NiiVue:

```python
mpat.view(op.join(output_dir, "mpat"), bundles=["LeftArcuate", "LeftCorticospinal"], glyphs=True)
```

and `mpat.save_html` writes the same scene as one web page:

```python
mpat.save_html("hbn_bundles.html", op.join(output_dir, "mpat"),
                      bundles=["LeftArcuate", "LeftCorticospinal"], glyphs=True)
```

The page for this run (left arcuate and left corticospinal, with glyphs) is
<a href="_static/examples/hbn_bundles.html">here</a> (1.6 MB; NiiVue loads from a CDN).

## Going further

- `moments=True` (`--moments` in the script) carries each walker's sub-voxel position. Bundles
  come out narrower, at about 5× the run time ({ref}`moments`).
- `bundles=[...]` (`--bundles` in the script) segments only some of the bundles.
